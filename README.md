# Protosequences
Analysis code and for the manuscript "Protosequences in brain organoids model intrinsic states in the developing cortex"

Use Main_analyses_matlab/preprocess_ks.m to inspect and preprocess the kilosort2 spike times into spike matrices. These spike matrices are subsequently used in Main_analyses_matlab/process_data_backbone.m and HMM_analysis_python for further processing the data. The remainder of the scripts plot the processed results.

For questions about the scripts and data, reach out to tjitse@ucsb.edu
